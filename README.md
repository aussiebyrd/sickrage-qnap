SickRage | For QNAP (Intel)
===========================
This will be my attapt to build (and maintain) a qpkg for an up-to-date and easy to install qpkg of SickRage for QNAP NAS servers.

I run a modified TS-509 Pro (with CPU (E7500 Core 2 Duo) and RAM upgrades), so wil only be building for 32-bit Intel QNAP devices (at least for now).

I surrently run SickRage (and have done from a vaiety of other build versions), but haven't found anyone to undates buids regulary; and given how fast the devs update, I'd like to maintain a more up-to-date package.

However, I'm new to GitHub and new to building QNAP packages (qpkg), so wish me luck!
